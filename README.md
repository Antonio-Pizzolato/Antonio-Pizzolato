### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Antonio Pizzolato, a university student at the University of Florence, studying Computer Engineering. Throughout my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to explore various programming languages, such as C, C++, Python, Java, HTML, CSS and Matlab.

ðŸŒ± I'm passionate about technology and software development, always looking for new challenges to improve my skills and learn new technologies. I'm particularly interested in web development and software engineering.

ðŸš€ I worked on some projects for my exams and studies, but also on personal side-projects, not only to learn things better by myself, but also to have fun!

ðŸ’¡ When I'm not working on my projects, I enjoy watching TV series and films especially the classic ones I didn't watch already (quite a lot I would say). I also enjoy playing video games, but also discovering new places near where I live.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out or check out my projects!
